# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction
I developed a Telecom Customer Churn Prediction model in Python using EDA, feature engineering, and ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, AdaBoost, XG Boost). Logistic Regression achieved 80% accuracy, with contract type, tenure, and monthly charges as key churn factors.
